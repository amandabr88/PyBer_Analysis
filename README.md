# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib tools.

new summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas knowledge. Also, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
This is a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

As shown below in the summary table, we can conclude that the urban cities have the highest number of rides and drivers. Also, that the Rural cities have the highest average Fare per Ride and per Driver.

## Summary

Using Pyber data analysis, it's possible to recomend some actions can be taken to address disparities between city types.

- Increase the number of drivers in Rural cities to meet the demand, as we have 125 rides for 78 drivers availables.
- The same for Suburban cities, where we have 490 drivers to attend 625 rides. So as an advice, they should increase the number of drivers in Suburbar citties to better meet the demand.
- However, for the Urban citiies, the number of drivers is higher than the number of rides available, which means a lower Fare per Driver in average. So, the realocation of the number of drivers in Urban cities to Suburban or Rural cities would help increase the average driver's Fare.
